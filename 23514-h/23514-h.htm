    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      There do not seem to be as many hares now as there used to be when I was a
      boy. Then the "old fields" and branch-bottoms used to be full of them.
      They were peculiarly our game; I mean we used to consider that they
      belonged to us boys. They were rather scorned by the "gentlemen," by which
      was meant the grown-up gentlemen, who shot partridges over the pointers,
      and only picked up a hare when she got in their way. And the negroes used
      to catch them in traps or "gums," which were traps made of hollow gum-tree
      logs. But we boys were the hare-hunters. They were our property from our
      childhood; just as much, we considered, as "Bruno" and "Don," the
      beautiful "crack" pointers, with their brown eyes and satiny ears and
      coats, were "the gentlemen's."
    </p>
    <p>
      The negroes used to set traps all the Fall and Winter, and we, with the
      natural tendency of boys to imitate whatever is wild and primitive, used
      to set traps also. To tell the truth, however, the hares appeared to have
      a way of going into the negroes' traps, rather than into ours, and the
      former caught many to our one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now, after many years, I can remember the delight of the frosty
      mornings; the joy with which we used to peep through the little panes of
      the dormer-windows at the white frost over the fields, which promised
      stronger chances of game being caught; the eagerness with which, oblivious
      of the cold, we sped through the garden, across the field, along the ditch
      banks, and up by the woods, making the round of our traps; the expectancy
      with which we peeped over the whitened weeds and through the bushes, to
      catch a glimpse of the gums in some "parf" or at some clearly marked
      "gap"; our disappointment when we found the door standing open and the
      trigger set just as we had left it the mormng before; our keen delight
      when the door was down; the dash for the trap; the scuffle to decide which
      should look in first; the peep at the brown ball screwed up back at the
      far end; the delicate operation, of getting the hare out of the trap; and
      the triumphant return home, holding up our spoil to be seen from afar. We
      were happier than we knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far to show how we came to regard hares as our natural game, and how,
      though to be bird-hunters we had to grow up, we were hare-hunters as boys.
      The rush, the cheers, the yells, the excitement were a part of the sport,
      to us boys the best part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, to hunt hares we had to have dogs&mdash;at least boys must have&mdash;the
      noise, the dash, the chase are half the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such dogs as ours were!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not allowable to take bird-dogs after hares. I say it was not
      allowable; I do not say it was not done, for sometimes, of course, the
      pointers <i>would</i> come, and we could not make them go back. But the
      hare-dogs were the puppies and curs, terriers, watch-dogs, and the
      nondescript crew which belonged to the negroes, and to the plantation
      generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pack they were! Thin, undersized black-and-tans, or spotted beasts
      of doubtful breed, called "houn's" by courtesy; long legged, sleepy
      watch-dogs from the "quarters," brindled or "yaller" mongrels, which even
      courtesy could not term other than "kyur dogs"; sharp-voiced "fises,"
      busier than bees, hunting like fury, as if they expected to find rats in
      every tuft of grass; and, when the hares got up, bouncing and bobbing
      along, not much bigger than the "molly cottontails" they were after,
      getting in everyone's way and receiving sticks and stones in profusion,
      but with their spirits unbroken. And all these were in one incongruous
      pack, growling, running, barking, ready to steal, fight, or hunt,
      whichever it happened to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used to have hunts on Saturdays, just we boys, with perhaps a black boy
      or two of our particular cronies; but the great hunt was "in the holidays"&mdash;that
      is, about Christmas. Then all the young darkies about the place were free
      and ready for sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Christmas hunt was an event.
    </p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the year 186&mdash;, and, Christmas-day falling on a Sunday,
      Saturday was given as the first day of the holidays. It had been a fine
      Fall; the cover was good, and old hares were plentiful. It had been
      determined some time before Christmas that we would have a big hare-hunt
      on that day, and the "boys"&mdash;that is, the young darkies&mdash;came to
      the house from the quarters, prepared for the sport, and by the time
      breakfast was over they were waiting for us around the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was always late about Christmas time; perhaps, the spareribs and
      sausages and the jelly dripping through a blanket hung over the legs of an
      upturned table accounted for it; and on, this Christmas eve it was ten by
      the tall clock in the corner of the dining-room before we were through.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came out, the merry darkies were waiting for us, grinning and
      showing their shining teeth, laughing and shouting and calling the dogs.
      They were not allowed to have guns; but our guns, long old single-barrels
      handed down for at least two generations, had been carried out and
      cleaned, and they were handing them around, inspecting and aiming them
      with as much pride as if they had been brand-new. There was only one
      exception to this rule: Uncle "Limpy-Jack," so called because he had one
      leg shorter than the other, was allowed to have a gun. He was a sort of
      professional hunter about the place. No lord was ever prouder of a special
      privilege handed down in his family for generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other boys were armed with stout sticks and made much noise. Uncle
      Limpy-Jack was in this respect also the only exception; he was grave as
      became a "man" who was a hunter by business, and "warn't arter no
      foolishness." He allowed no one to touch his gun, which thus possessed a
      special value. He carried his powder in a gourd and his shot in an old
      rag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pack of dogs I have described, fully recruited, were hanging around,
      growling and snarling, sneaking into the kitchen and being kicked out by
      Aunt Betty and her corps of varicolored assistants, largely augmented at
      the approach of Christmas with its cheer. The yelping of the mongrel pack,
      the shouts and whoops of the boys, and the laughter of the maids or men
      about the kitchen and back-yard, all in their best clothes and in high
      spirits, were exhilarating, and with many whoops and much "hollering," we
      climbed the yard fence, and, disdaining a road, of course, set out down
      the hill across the field, taking long strides, each one bragging loudly
      of what he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me see: there were John and Andrew and Black Peter, and Bow-legged
      Saul, and Milker-Tim, and Billy, and Uncle Limpy-Jack, and others now
      forgotten, and the three white boys. And the dogs, "Ole Rattler," and "Ole
      Nim-rod," who had always been old by their names, and were regarded with
      reverence akin to fetich-worship because they were popularly supposed to
      be able to trail a hare. It was a de-lusion, I am now satisfied; for I
      cannot recall that they ever trailed one certainly three feet. Then there
      were the "guard dawgs": "Hector," brindled, bob-tailed, and ugly, and
      "Jerry," yellow, long-tailed, and mean; then there was "Jack," fat,
      stumpy, and ill-natured; there were the two pointers, Bruno and Don, the
      beauties and pride of the family, with a pedigree like a prince's, who,
      like us, were taking a holiday hunt, but, unlike us, without permission;
      "Rock," Uncle Limpy-Jack's "hyah dawg," and then the two terriers "Snip"
      and "Snap." We beat the banks of the spring ditch for form's sake, though
      there was small chance of a hare there, because it was pasture and the
      banks were kept clean. Then we made for the old field beyond, the dogs
      spreading out and nosing around lazily, each on his own hook. Whether
      because of the noise we made and their seeking safety in flight, or
      because they were off "taking holiday"{1} as the negroes claimed, no hares
      were found, and after a half-hour our ardor was a little dampened. But we
      soon set to work in earnest and began to beat a little bottom lying
      between two hills, through which ran a ditch, thickly grown up with bushes
      and briers. The dead swamp-grass was very heavy in the narrow little
      bottom along the sides, and was matted in tufts. The dogs were scattered,
      and prowling around singly or in couples; and only one of the pointers and
      Snip were really on the ditch. Snip showed signs of great industry, and
      went bobbing backward and forward through a patch of heavy matted grass.
      In any other dog this might have excited suspicion, even hope. There are,
      however, some dogs that are natural liars. Snip was one of them. Snip's
      failing was so well known that no attention was paid to him. He gave,
      indeed, a short bark, and bounced up two or three times like a trap-ball,
      looking both ways at once; but this action only called down upon him
      universal derision.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The hares, according to the negroes, used to take holidays
     and would not go into traps in this season; so the only way
     to get them was by hunting them.
</pre>
    <p>
      Just then, however, a small boy pointed over to the top of the hill
      calling, "Look-a yander," and shouts arose, "Dyah she go!" "Dyah she go!"
      "Dyah she go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, there, just turning the hill, went a "molly cotton,"
      bouncing. In a second we were all in full chase and cry, shouting to each
      other, "whooping" on the dogs, and running with all our might. We were so
      carried away by the excitement that not one of us even thought of the fact
      that she would come stealing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      No negro can resist the inclination to shout "Dyah she go!" and to run
      after a hare when one gets up; it is involuntary and irresistible. Even
      Uncle Limpy-Jack came bobbing along for a while, shouting, "Dyah she go!"
      at the top of his voice; but being soon distanced he called his dog, Rock,
      and went back to beat the ditch bank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiasm of the chase carried us all into the piece of pine beyond
      the fence, where the pines were much too thick to see anything and where
      only an occasional glimpse of a dog running backward and forward, or an
      instinctive "oun-oun!" from the hounds, rewarded us. But "molly is berry
      sly," and while the dogs were chasing each other around the pines, she was
      tripping back down through the field to the place where we had started
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were recalled by hearing an unexpected "bang" from the field behind us,
      and dashing out of the woods we found Uncle Limpy-Jack holding up a hare,
      and with a face whose gravity might have done for that of Fate. He was
      instantly surrounded by the entire throng, whom he regarded with superb
      disdain and spoke of as "you chillern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "G' on, you chillern, whar you is gwine, and meek you' noise somewhar
      else, an' keep out o' my way. I want to git some hyahs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He betrayed his pleasure only once, when, as he measured out the shot from
      an old rag into his seamed palm, he said with a nod of his head: "Y' all
      kin <i>run</i> ole hyahs; de ole man' <i>shoots</i> 'em." And as we
      started off we heard him muttering:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Ole Molly Hyah,
     What yo' doin' dyah?
     Settin' in de cornder
     Smokin' a cigah."
</pre>
    <p>
      We went back to the branch and began again to beat the bushes, Uncle
      Limpy-Jack taking unquestioned the foremost place, which had heretofore
      been held by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a movement, a sort of scamper, a rash, as something
      slipped out of the heavy grass at our feet and vanished in the thick
      briers of the ditch bank. "Dy ah she go!" arose from a dozen throats, and
      gone she was, in fact, safe in a thicket of briers which no dog nor negro
      could penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bushes were vigorously beaten, however, and all of us, except Uncle
      Limpy-Jack and Milker-Tim, crossed over to the far side of the ditch where
      the bottom widened, when suddenly she was discovered over on the same
      side, on the edge of the little valley. She had stolen out, the negroes
      declared, licking her paws to prevent leaving a scent, and finding the
      stretch of hillside too bare to get across, was stealing back to her
      covert again, going a little way and then squatting, then going a few
      steps and squatting again. "Dyah she go!" "Dyah she go!" resounded as
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang!&mdash;bang!&mdash;snap!&mdash;bang! went the four guns in quick
      succession, tearing up the grass anywhere from one to ten yards away from
      her. As if she had drawn their fire and was satisfied that she was safe,
      she turned and sped up the hill, the white tail bobbing derisively,
      followed by the dogs strung out in line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, all of us had some good excuse for missing, Uncle Limpy-Jack's
      being the only valid one&mdash;that his cap had snapped. He made much of
      this, complaining violently of "dese yere wuthless caps!" With a pin he
      set to work, and he had just picked the tube, rammed painfully some grains
      of powder down in it, and put on another cap which he had first examined
      with great care to impress us. "Now, let a ole hyah git up," he said, with
      a shake of his head. "She got <i>man</i> ready for her, she ain't got you
      chil-lern." The words were scarcely spoken when a little darkey called
      out, "Dyah she come!" and sure enough she came, "lipping" down a furrow
      straight toward us. Uncle Limpy-Jack was on that side of the ditch and
      Milker-Tim was near him armed only with a stout well-balanced stick about
      two feet long. As the hare came down the hill, Uncle Jack brought up his
      gun, took a long aim and fired. The weeds and dust flew up off to one side
      of her, and she turned at right angles out of the furrow; but as she got
      to the top of the bed, Milker-Tim, flinging back his arm, with the
      precision of a bushman, sent his stick whirling like a boomerang skimming
      along the ground after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim with a yell rushed at her and picked her up, shouting, "I got her! I
      got her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Uncle Limpy-Jack pitched into him: "What you doin' gittin' in my
      way!" he complained angrily. "Ain' you got no better sense 'n to git in my
      way like dat! Did n' you see how nigh I come to blowin' yo' brains out!
      Did n' you see I had de hyah when you come pokin' yer wooly black head in
      my way! Ef I had n' flung my gun off, whar 'd you 'a' been now! Don' you
      come pokin' in my way ag'in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim was too much elated to be long affected by even this severity, and
      when he had got out of Uncle Jack's way he sang out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Ole Molly Hyah,
     You' ears mighty thin.
     Yes, yes, yes,
     I come a-t'ippin' thoo de win'!"
</pre>
    <p>
      So far the honors were all Uncle Jack's and Milker-Tim's, and it was
      necessary for the rest of us to do something. Accordingly, the bottom
      having been well hunted, the crowd struck out for an old field over the
      hill, known as "the long hillside." It was thick in hen-grass and
      broom-straw, and sloped down from a piece of pine with a southern exposure
      on which the sun shone warm. We had not reached it before a hare jumped
      out of a bush near Charlie. In a few moments, another bounced out before
      one of the dogs and went dashing across the field. Two shots followed her;
      but she kept on till at last one of the boys secured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were going down the slope when Peter called in great excitement,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heah a ole hyah settin' in her haid. Come heah, Dan, quick! Gi' me your
      gun; le' me git him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was more than Dan bargained for, as he had not got one himself yet.
      He ran up quickly enough, but held on tightly to his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he? Show him to me: I 'll knock him over."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he would not give up the gun, Peter pointed out the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right under dat bush&mdash;right dyah" (pointing). "See him? Teck keer
      dyah, Don, teck keer," he called, as Don came to a point just beyond. "See
      him?" He pointed a black finger with tremulous eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Dan did not see, so he reluctantly yielded up the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter took aim long and laboriously, shut both eyes, pulled the trigger,
      and blazed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dash of white and brown, a yell, and Don wheeled around with
      his head between his forepaws stung by the shot as "molly" fled streaking
      it over the hill followed only by the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's face was a study. If he had killed one of us he could not have
      looked more like a criminal, nor have heard more abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Limpy-Jack poured out on him such a volume of vituperation and
      contempt that he was almost white, he was so ashy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don was not permanently hurt; but one ear was pierced by several shot,
      which was a serious affair, as his beauty was one of his good points, and
      his presence on a hare-hunt was wholly against the rules. Uncle Limpy-Jack
      painted the terrors of the return home for Peter with a vividness so
      realistic that its painfulness pierced more breasts than Peter's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don was carried to the nearest ditch, and the entire crowd devoted itself
      to doctoring his ear. It was decided that he should be taken to the
      quarters and kept out of sight during the Christmas, in the hope that his
      ear would heal. We all agreed not to say anything about it if not
      questioned. Uncle Limpy-Jack had to be bribed into silence by a liberal
      present of shot and powder from us. But he finally consented. However,
      when Met, in a wild endeavor to get a shot at a stray partridge which got
      up before us, missed the bird and let Uncle Limpy-Jack, at fifty yards,
      have number-six pellets in the neck and shoulder, Peter's delinquency was
      forgotten. The old man dropped his gun and yelled, "Oh! Oh!" at the top of
      his voice. "Oh! I 'm dead, I 'm dead, I 'm dead." He lay down on the
      ground and rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Met was scared to death and we were all seriously frightened. Limpy-Jack
      himself may have thought he was really killed. He certainly made us think
      so. He would not let anyone look at the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few of the shot had gone in, and he was not seriously injured, but
      he vowed that it was all done on purpose, and that he was "going straight
      home and tell Marster," a threat he was only prevented from executing by
      us all promising him the gold dollars which we should find in the toes of
      our stockings next morning.

      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      So far the day had been rather a failure; the misfortunes had exceeded the
      sport; but as we reached the long hillside I have spoken of, the fun
      began. The hares were sunning themselves comfortably in their beds, and we
      had not gone more than two hundred yards before we had three up, and
      cutting straight down the hill before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang!&mdash;bang!&mdash;bang!&mdash;bang! went the guns. One hare was
      knocked over, and one boy also by the kick of his gun; the others were a
      sight chase, and every boy, man, and dog joined in it for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoop!&mdash;whoop! Dyah she go! Dyah she go! Heah, heah! Heah, heah!
      Heah, heah, heah! Whoop, Rattler! Whoop, Nimrod! Heah, Snip! heah, heah,
      Bruno! Heah, heah!" Everyone was striving to get ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both hares were picked up before reaching cover, one being caught by
      Bruno, who was magnificent in a chase. After many falls and failures by
      all of us, Saul flung himself on the other, and gave a wild yell of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "long hillside" was full of hares; they bounced out of the hen-grass;
      slipped from brush-heaps and were run down, or by their speed and agility
      escaped us all. The dogs got the frenzy and chased wildly, sometimes
      running over them and losing them through a clever double and dash. The
      old field rang with the chase until we turned our steps toward home to get
      ready for the fun after dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were crossing the pasture on our way home. The winter sunset sky was
      glowing like burnished steel; the tops of the great clump of oaks and
      hickories in which the house stood were all that we could see over the far
      hill; a thin line of bluish smoke went straight up in the quiet air. The
      dogs had gone on ahead, even the two or three old watch-dogs ran after the
      others, with their noses in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of concealing Don and his ragged ears came up. It was
      necessary to catch him and keep him from the house. We started up the
      slope after him. As we climbed the hill we heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dee got a ole hyah now; come on," exclaimed one or two of the younger
      negroes; but old Limpy-Jack came to a halt, and turning his head to one
      side listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heish! Dat ain' no ole hyah dey 're arter; dey 're arter Marster's sheep&mdash;dat
      's what 'tis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started off at a rapid gait. We did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep, yep! Oun, oun, oun! Err, err, err!" came their voices in full cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached the top of the hill. Sure enough, there they were, the fat
      Southdowns, tearing like mad across the field, the sound of their
      trampling reaching us, with the entire pack at their heels, the pointers
      well in the lead. Such a chase as we had trying to catch that pack of
      mischievous dogs! Finally we got them in; but not before the whole
      occurrence had been seen at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts that were borne to us, as rescuers began to troop across the
      fields, drove our hearts down into our boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return to the house was widely different from the triumph of the
      out-going in the morning. It was a dejected cortege that wended its
      toilsome way up the hill. Uncle Limpy-Jack basely deserted us after
      getting the promise of our gold dollars, declaring that he "told dem boys
      dat huntin' ole hyahs warn' no business for chillern!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We knew that we had to "face the condign." There was no maudlin sentiment
      in that region. Solomon was truly believed to have been the wisest of men,
      and at least one of his decrees was still acted on in that pious
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black boys were shipped off to their mammies and I fear received their
      full share of "the condign."
    </p>
    <p>
      We were ushered solemnly into the house and were marched upstairs to
      meditate on our enormities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could hear the debate going on below, and now and then a gentle voice
      took up the cause. Presently a slow step mounted the stair and the door
      opened. It was a grave senior&mdash;owner of Don. We knew that we were
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys, did n't you know better than that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Three culprits looked at each other sideways and remained speechless. We
      were trying to figure out which was the more politic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, this is Christmas&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A time of peace and good-will," said Met under his breath, but loud
      enough to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and that 's the reason I am going to appeal to you as to what
      should be done to you. Suppose you were in my place and I in yours, and
      you had told me never&mdash;<i>never</i> to take the pointers out to run
      hares, and I knew I was disobeying you, and yet I had done it deliberately&mdash;<i>deliberately</i>
      disobeyed you&mdash;what would you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess that the case seemed hopeless. But Met saved the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll tell you what I 'd do, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd give you another chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm&mdash;-ah&mdash;ur&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, too much for him, and he first began to smile and then to
      laugh. Met also broke out into a laugh, knowing that he had caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So peace and good-will were restored and Christmas really began.
